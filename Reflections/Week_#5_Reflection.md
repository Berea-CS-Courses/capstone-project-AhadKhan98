# Week # 4: Reflection

## Accomplishments:

1. Deleted match objects after both users have successfully connected to the chat session.
2. Created a session object in the database that contains information regarding the match.
3. Attached the session object to users' active session field and auto-redirect them if they have an active chat session.
4. Added functionality for ending the chat session.
5. Notified users if someone disconnects from the chat room.
6. Created a UI for the Leave Feedback screen.

## Challenges

1. I was stuck on trying to make sure that both users connected to the chat room before deleting the match query from the databse. I accomplished that using sockets to count the number of connected users in a room.
