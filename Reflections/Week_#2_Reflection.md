# Week # 2: Reflection

## Accomplishments:

1. Implemented user signup flow using the backend api to create new user objects in MongoDB. 
2. Implemented user login flow using the backend api to log existing users in. 
3. Created a table in MongoDB and add functionality for storing pending matches. 
4. Created the helper profile page in the frontend.
5. Facilitated data required by the helper profile page from the database.
6. Changed all React components to query data from the API rather than being hardcoded.

## Challenges

1. I spent quite some time trying to configure MongoDB to work with my express server. Initially, I was using the wrong library but after some research found out the issue and was able to solve it.
2. It was difficult to start making http requests to my backend and wait for the response. However, looking at the documentation for axios helped a lot.

## Goals for Next Week

2. Delete objects from the 'match' table when a match is found. Complete by Thursday.
3. Create a simple UI for the Chat Room component. Complete by Tuesday.
