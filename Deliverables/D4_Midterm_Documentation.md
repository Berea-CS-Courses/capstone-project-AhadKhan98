# Proof of Concept

To demonstrate the proof of concept, two separate entities are created, the frontend in React and the backend in Node JS. Following the creation, a connection is established between the two to ensure the transfer of data.

## Communication Between The Two

## Success

_Alerting the user when the server is running and returning responses successfully._
<br><br>

<img src="./d4_assets/proof-of-concept/react_success.PNG" height="200px"/><br>
_Showing the message received by the server on the user interface._
<br><br>

## Failure

<img src="./d4_assets/proof-of-concept/react_failed_alert.PNG" height="250px"/><br>
_Alerting the user when the server is either not running or failed to return a valid response._
<br><br>

<img src="./d4_assets/proof-of-concept/react_failed.PNG" height="200px"/><br>
_Showing the error message on the user interface._
