# D0 - Project Ideas and Github Flow

## Idea 1

### Problem:

The problem that this idea is trying to address is the lack of real-time help available for programmers. Imagine a scenario where someone just started learning JavaScript and got stuck on something. After searching for hours on youtube and other resources, the person can't find an accurate solution to the problem. Now, instead of posting his question to StackOverflow or Quora, and waiting for hours until he gets an answer/response back, he could utilize this app. This app would match people who are wanting to learn different programming languages, with people who are experts in that field. The matching would done in real-time. After a successful match, users would have to option to share their screen, share images and chat amongst each other to try to solve the problem at hand together. One additional feature could be the implementation of an economy system where people who help others receive coins and the people who seek help spend coins.

### Target:

The target audience would be software developers and programmers. Pretty much all skill levels would work out just fine as we would have newbie programmers wanting to seek guidance and on the other hand, we would have expert programmers who want to help out the community.

### Modalities:

- Web Application
- Mobile Application

### Enthusiasm Score:

5/5

## Idea 2

### Problem:

Even after the new myBerea update, there are a lot of issues when working with the myBerea portal. More importantly, even after the update, there isn't a native application for mobile users. The users are currently being presented with the Desktop site even when using the myBerea portal on a mobile device. The idea is to create a mobile application that has a very easy to use user interface. The mobile app would support all mobile devices and implement a responsive design so that each user can have a seamless experience regardless of their mobile device.

### Target:

Students of berea that prefer borwing myBerea on their mobile devices.

### Modalities:

Mobile Applcation (iOS & Android)

### Enthusiasm Score:

4/5

## Idea 3

### Problem:

The Berea College Labor Program department has a training center that allows supervisors and students to be able to rent out items such as books, ebooks, magazines, iPads and laptops. The process of checking out these items is currently done manually which often results in out of date measurements for the number of items being rented out, their due dates, the items available, etc. The idea is to create a web application that provides a straight forward UI that automates the whole process of checking out items and sending reminder emails etc.

### Target:

The staff and the student works of the labor program.

### Modalities:

- Web Application

### Enthusiasm Score:

4/5
