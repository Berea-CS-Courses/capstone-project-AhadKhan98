### **<ins>Front-end UI</ins>**

**Overview:** This component will be responsible for the visual interface of the web app. It will contain a UI that is easy to interact with, and provide all the functionality to the users by communicating with other components.  
**Interactions:** Communicating with the Backend API component, this component will be able to access data contained in the database (users, user types, matches, etc.). The data will then be shown to the users depending on certain situations. Every time the front-end ui component needs to get or set data, it will do so using the backend API component.  
**Requirements:** In order to style the UI design, this component will make use of HTML and CSS files. An additional library called Material-UI is required to aid in the design process.  
**Importance:** This is a very important component because without it, the user would have no clue on navigating the web app. This component would provide a very easy to use UI so that the users instantly know how to perform actions on the web app. For example, logging in would be as simple as clicking a button.
