# Overview

In order to test the complete web-application, I decided to use a two step approach. Since the backend and the frontend can function independently, I decided to use unit testing for the backend to test for routes and test the response for varying forms of input. And for the front-end I went with a cognitive walkthrough approach where my application was put infront of 3 different people, and their interactions were recorded.

# Testing The Backend: Unit Testing

# Testing The Frontend: Cognitive Walkthrough

Since the web-application has a bunch of different features that the user can engage in, using a cognitive walkthrough would be suitable in order to identify how users interact with the system and whether it confuses them or not.

The users were asked to perform the tasks below in order. Instrucions on how to achieve the tasks is also given below.

1. Register for a new account  
   **Instructions:** _The user should click on the button that says "Register" on the top right side of the page. Then the user should fill out the form with their information and press the "Sign Up" button._

   **Instructions:** _The user should make sure that the toggle button is pointing towards "Get Help". After that the user should click on the icon that says "Web Development". On the next screen, the user should select the icon for "javascript" and proceed to fill out the problem statement._
